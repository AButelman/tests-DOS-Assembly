# README

## A couple of different programs I've made to learn 16 bit DOS Assembly language, mostly to manipulate the screen.
## The emulator I used to test them is [DosBox](http://dosbox.com)

ADELANTE.COM slowly fills the screen with flickering Hs from the beginning to the end.

ANIM.COM fades the screen in and out between black and white.

ANIM2.COM fades the screen between multiple colors.

ATRAS.COM does the same that the above mentioned program but in a reversed fashion.

CLEAR.COM just, well, clears the screen.

COLORES.COM turns the background of the screen to diffent colors, spacebar changes to the next color, any other key exists.

ROJO.COM turns the background of the visible screen to red and the letters to light grey.
